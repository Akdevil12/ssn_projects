      <h5>Written on 3 Setember, 2019</h5>
      
      <p>
          For those who have followed my blogs so far, you know that I am an unbiased blogger who writes the best and worst of everything I come across. 
          For a change, this time I think I&#39ll let you guys know what fascinated and continues to fascinate me to pursue a cyber security career. 
          <br><br>The world has become so digitized that even a kid with a net connection can learn everything. 
          In such a world, privacy protection is an immense task that is required across various domains.
          From basic ciphers to complex encryptions the world of cyber security is a very diverse one. 
          <br><br>As a beginner in this field, the first thing I learnt was image steganography, a type of hiding technique where you store data in an image and this fascinates and intrigues me to this day.
          As a cyber retrieval specialist, I have always known how crucial protection of one&#39s system, but no system is impenetrable especially if you have WiFi. 
          <br><br>As a cyber personal, my preferred OS has always been Kali Linux and a favourite statement of mine is that <Q>The quieter you are, the more you can hear</q>. It has remained a personal favourite because of its relevance in today&#39.
          Following a few basic steps are all that is required to enter the cyber security industry and the aim of this blog is to make the readers ask questions and explore all various avenues .
          <br><BR>
    
          
          Any human who has used internet knows what it is to be under networks. 
          So let&#39s talk about it today. This huge world with its humongous network, ensures we remain in contact always. 
          There&#39s no part of the world unreachable and also there’s no way you can skip any office work. 
          <br><BR>Kudos to that! I remember the first time I got to read and learn about networks, it was mind blowing. 
          In layman terms, my company&#39s network is so well organised that all the files I upload are always in place and accessible by me from anywhere. 
          Of course, I keep it safe from prying eyes, but guys, do give the topic a read!
